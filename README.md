# Smart-Contract

## The goals of our Smart Contract include:
1  group sending different amounts of our token to different ‘wallet address’ on a regular schedule (eg. once a month);
2  the amount of our token for each address is calculated according to some ‘credit’ in an excel table, so make sure it can be parsed to the contract;
3  50% dilution rule: say initially 1 token = 1 credit, when the amount of our token left reaches 50% of the total, 1 token = 2 credit; when the amount left reaches 25%, 1 token = 4 credit, recursively.
